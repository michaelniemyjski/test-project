<h3><em>Michael Niemyjski</em></h3>

<p>Within this little excerpt, I will briefly explain:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
<li>why digital publishing is important to me</li>
<li>what I think I can get out of digital publishing</li>
<li>what I want from digital publishing</li>
</ol>

<p>Digital publishing allows my art the possibility to reach a large audience. This is something that I want because I want others to relate to me from an artistic and maybe even a spiritual standpoint.</p>

<p>Publishing is significant to me because of that reason, and it gives me the form of a goal. Knowing that digital publishing opens the door to easily letting hundreds of people see who I am makes that goal more believable.

<p><i><strong>Also, publishing my work digitally wouldnâ€™t cost me anything other than my own time.
</p></i></strong>
<p>I think that it is important to do what you can, to get your hands dirty so that you may achieve your goals. All is true, especially within the world of art.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it is important to publish digitally, but I also want the experience of companionship while working with others. I was thinking maybe like a humble animation or graphic novel studio.

<p>As Mewtwo from the Pokemon franchise once said:</p>
