<h1> Reflection </h1>
<p> Learning to use a form of coding for publishing I feel has opened opportunities that I can take advantage of, especially with the exercise of making your own website. For instance, learning how to make a site, even at its most simple form has given me an idea of what I could do with my own site that showcases my creations. As for the little journey leading up to publishing a site, I feel like what Iâ€™ve been working with has been fairly straight forward, most of the time at least. At first, it felt like a lot of words and coding related short phrases in my face, which confused me for a short amount of time. Everything after that was smooth sailing until HTML popped up as an exercise. It took me more time than I thought it would to learn the basics of HTML, and to convert it into a usable file. I did not know how to convert or use a webpage to create a downloadable HTML document, which caused me stress. I figured it out, thankfully, by downloading an HTML extension in the notes app on the computer.

<p>Overall, I accomplished in learning the different styles of digital publishing that I was exposed to, and figured out that in its most simple form, its very straightforward as long as you can remember the phrases and tools at your disposal.</p>
